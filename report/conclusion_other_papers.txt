ideas from the paper about mali:

more rain in growing season -> better for children
more rain after growing season -> bad for children

heavy rain can increase the time to get to a market or medical health care
also it can make it impossible to get food over a long period of time. the poorer a family the higher the child mortality therefore during longer bad weather periods.

higher temperatures also have a bad effect, probably because of something like heat stress and worse conditions for the things mainly grown in agriculture.

somewhere in the paper is stated that at specific conditions, another day of 12mm precipitation can increase child mortality by 0.45%

not a direct correlation between GDP and child mortality. in mali because they produce for export???

also the weather effects not only the household budget but also impacts humans physiology which than also has an effect on child mortality



ideas from the paper about senegal:

the weather also affects the time when the children are born, which in turn has an effect on their survival rate. also the familyâ€™s income changes with weather conditions, since many families in developing countries are directly dependent on agriculture.
